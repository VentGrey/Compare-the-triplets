//Compare the triplets.

/* Alice and Bob each created one problem for @HackerRank. A reviewer rates the
two challenges, the first being Alice, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100
for three categories: problem clarity, originality and difficulty.

We define the rating for Alice's challenge to be the triplet 'a' being
a = [a[0], a[1], a[2]]

And the rating for Bob's challenge to be the triplet 'b' being
b = [b[0], b[1], b[2]]

Your task is to find their comparison points by comparing:

a[0] with b[0]
a[1] with b[1]
a[2] with b[2]

Conditions:
if a[i] > b[i] -> Alice is awarded with one point.

if a[i] < b[i] -> Bob is awarded with one point.

if a[i] == b[i] -> Neither Alice nor Bob receive a point.
